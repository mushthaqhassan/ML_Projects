# ML_Projects

This EDA project aims to analyze a dataset by understanding its structure, handling missing values, visualizing data, and deriving insights. The project uses Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Key steps include data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. The repository provides installation instructions and a Jupyter Notebook for analysis. The findings and insights help in making data-driven decisions.
